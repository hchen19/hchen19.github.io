This is a blog post of Gaussian processes (GPs) introduction and review of scalable GPs. GPs are a nonparametric machine learning technique used to solve regression, classification, and other probabilistic problems. 

Definition
======
A **Gaussian process (GP)** is a collection of random variables such that any finite collection of those random variables have a joint Gaussian distribution. It is an extension of the multivariate Gaussian distribution to infinite dimensions. A GP is specified by a mean function $\mu(\cdot)$ and a kernel function $K(\cdot,\cdot)$. Let $f(\cdot): \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be an unknown function with domain $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$.  The corresponding GP is denoted by 
$$f(\cdot) \sim \mathcal{GP}( \mu(\cdot), K(\cdot,\cdot) )$$
